## LED
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it.

## BUZZER
Buzzer is an electrical device, which is similar to a bell that makes a buzzing noise and is used for signaling.

## RELAY
A power relay module is an electrical switch that is operated by an electromagnet. The electromagnet 
is activated by a separate low-power signal from a micro controller.

When electrical current is passed through a coil, it generates a magnetic 
field that in turn activates the armature.


## GSM MODULE
This module is able to receive serial data from radiation monitoring devices such as survey
meter or area monitor and transmit the data as text SMS to a host server.

## SMOKESENSOR
It detect smoke by sensing small particles in the air,Once they detect those particles above a certain threshold, they signal the alarm to sound.

## RESET
A power on reset circuit ensures the system power supply stabilizes at the correct levels, the clocks of the processors settle accurately, 
and that the loading of the internal registers is complete before the device actually starts working or gets powered up.
